Insertion array : arr[] = [1,3,4,2]
arr[] = [1,2,3,4]

Insertion Sort is a sorting algorithm in which we pick an element and move it to its sorted position. We pick an element, compare it to the elements present before it, and change the elementsâ€™ position until the current element is smaller than the elements present before it.





#include <bits/stdc++.h> 
void insertionSort(int n, vector<int> &arr){
    for (int i=1 ; i<n ; i++){  // using for loop
        int temp = arr[i];   // storing value temporary
        int j = i-1;  // before j i.e. array is now sorted
        for (; j>=0 ; j--){ //running loop for j
            if( arr[j]> temp){
                arr[j+1] = arr[j];  //comparing and shifting
            }
            else {
                break;
            }
        }
        arr[j+1] = temp;

    }
}
