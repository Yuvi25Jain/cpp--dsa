#BASICS OF DSA

1. ARRAY:
collection of similar type data sotred at contiguos blocks of memory.
random access of data
int a[6] = {10,20}
advantage of array is we can access the element in constant time i.e it has time complexcity of O(1
)

2. LINKED LIST:
collection of elements but elements are not stored at continuous memory. it contain only element along with address .

3.  STACK :
it is linear data structure that follow last in first out. insertion(push) and removal(pop)

4. QUEUE:
linear data structure first in first out. insertion push and removal pop.
